In this EDA project, I will be handling marathon data from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633
In this project I will be using python to clean the data such as removing null values and changing the name of the columns and transforming the data for further analysis.
I also plot graphs using Seaborn to analyze patterns in the dataset.

Tools Used:
Python - Pandas, numpy, seaborn
